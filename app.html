    <h1>TIRAMISU</h1>
   <h3> Ingredients:</h3>
6 large egg yolks
3/4 cup granulated sugar
1 cup mascarpone cheese, softened
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
2 cups strong brewed coffee or espresso, cooled to room temperature
1/4 cup coffee liqueur (such as Kahlua), optional
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
24-30 ladyfingers (savoiardi biscuits)
Cocoa powder, for dusting
Dark chocolate shavings, for garnish
<h3>Instructions:</h3>

    <h1>RASMALAI</h1>
  <h3>  Ingredients:</h3>

<h4>For the Paneer Balls (Rasgullas):</h4>

4 cups whole milk
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/4 cup sugar
4 cups water
<h4>For the Milk Syrup:</h4>

4 cups whole milk
1/2 cup sugar
4-5 green cardamom pods, crushed
A pinch of saffron strands (optional)
Chopped pistachios or almonds for garnish
<h3>Instructions:</h3>

Start by making the paneer balls (rasgullas). Heat 4 cups of whole milk in a heavy-bottomed pan until it comes to a boil.

Once the milk starts boiling, reduce the heat to low and add lemon juice gradually while stirring continuously. The milk will start to curdle.

Continue to cook until the milk solids separate completely from the whey. Turn off the heat once you see a clear separation.

Strain the curdled milk through a muslin cloth or a fine sieve. Rinse the paneer under cold water to remove the lemony flavor.

Gather the edges of the cloth and squeeze out excess water from the paneer. Hang the cloth for about 30 minutes to drain any remaining water.

After 30 minutes, transfer the paneer to a plate and knead it well until it becomes smooth and soft.

Divide the paneer into small portions and roll them into smooth balls without any cracks.

In a separate wide pan, add 4 cups of water and 1/4 cup of sugar. Bring it to a boil.

Gently drop the paneer balls into the boiling sugar syrup. Cover and cook for about 15-20 minutes on medium heat. The paneer balls will double in size.

Once cooked, turn off the heat and let them cool in the syrup for a while.

Meanwhile, prepare the milk syrup. In another pan, heat 4 cups of whole milk over medium heat.

Add sugar, crushed cardamom pods, and saffron strands (if using). Let the milk simmer until it reduces to about half its original volume, stirring occasionally.

Once the milk has thickened, turn off the heat and let it cool slightly.

Gently squeeze the excess syrup from the paneer balls and transfer them to the thickened milk (rabri).

Allow the rasmalai to chill in the refrigerator for a few hours before serving.

Garnish with chopped pistachios or almonds before serving.

    <h1>RASGULLA</h1>
    
  <h3>  Ingredients:</h3>

<h3>For the Paneer Balls (Rasgullas):</h3>

1 liter full-fat milk
2 tablespoons lemon juice or vinegar
1 cup sugar
4 cups water
<h3>Instructions:</h3>

Start by making the paneer. In a large heavy-bottomed pot, bring the milk to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally to prevent it from sticking to the bottom.

Once the milk comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low and add the lemon juice or vinegar gradually while stirring continuously. The milk will curdle, and the whey will separate from the curdled milk solids (paneer).

Once the milk has completely curdled and you see a clear separation of whey and curdled milk solids, turn off the heat.

Line a large strainer or colander with a clean muslin cloth or cheesecloth. Pour the curdled milk through the cloth to strain out the whey.

Rinse the paneer under cold running water to remove the sourness of the lemon juice or vinegar.

Gather the edges of the cloth and squeeze out excess water from the paneer. Hang the cloth with the paneer for about 30 minutes to drain any remaining water.

After 30 minutes, transfer the paneer to a large plate or bowl. Knead the paneer with the heel of your hand until it becomes smooth and soft. This process helps in making smooth rasgulla balls.

Divide the paneer into small portions and roll them into smooth balls without any cracks. Make sure the balls are compact and smooth.

In a wide pot, mix 1 cup of sugar with 4 cups of water and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves completely.

Gently drop the paneer balls into the boiling sugar syrup one by one. Cover the pot with a lid and let them cook for about 15-20 minutes on medium heat. The paneer balls will double in size.

Once the paneer balls are cooked, turn off the heat and let them cool in the sugar syrup for a while.

Rasgullas are ready to be served warm or chilled. You can store them in the refrigerator for up to 4-5 days. Enjoy these delicious homemade rasgullas as a sweet treat!

Note: It's important to handle the paneer balls gently to prevent them from breaking while cooking. Also, the size of the rasgullas will increase while cooking, so make sure to leave some space in the pot for them to expand.

   <h3> Ingredients:</h3>

<h4>For the Gulab Jamun:</h4>

1 cup milk powder
1/4 cup all-purpose flour (maida)
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
2 tablespoons ghee or melted butter
3-4 tablespoons milk (as needed to make the dough)
Oil or ghee for deep frying
For the Sugar Syrup (Chashni):

2 cups sugar
2 cups water
4-5 green cardamom pods, crushed
A few saffron strands (optional)
1 teaspoon rose water or 1/2 teaspoon rose essence (optional)
<h3>Instructions:</h3>

Start by preparing the sugar syrup (chashni). In a saucepan, combine sugar and water. Place it over medium heat and stir until the sugar completely dissolves.

Add crushed cardamom pods and saffron strands to the sugar syrup for flavor. You can also add rose water or rose essence for a fragrant touch. Let the syrup simmer for 5-7 minutes, then turn off the heat. Keep the sugar syrup warm.

In a mixing bowl, combine milk powder, all-purpose flour, and baking soda. Mix well to ensure there are no lumps.

Add ghee or melted butter to the dry ingredients and mix using your fingers until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.

Gradually add milk, a tablespoon at a time, and knead gently to form a soft dough. The dough should be smooth and slightly sticky. Be careful not to over-knead the dough.

Divide the dough into small portions and roll them between your palms to form smooth, crack-free balls. Make sure there are no cracks on the surface of the balls.

Heat oil or ghee in a deep pan over medium-low heat. The oil should be moderately hot, not too hot, to avoid burning the gulab jamuns.

Gently slide the prepared dough balls into the hot oil, a few at a time, and fry them on low to medium heat. Stir occasionally to ensure even browning. Fry until they turn golden brown and evenly cooked from all sides. This should take about 8-10 minutes.

Once the gulab jamuns are golden brown, remove them from the oil using a slotted spoon and drain excess oil by placing them on paper towels.

Immediately transfer the hot fried gulab jamuns into the warm sugar syrup. Let them soak in the syrup for at least 1-2 hours to absorb the sweetness and flavors.

Serve the gulab jamuns warm or at room temperature. You can garnish them with chopped nuts like pistachios or almonds for an extra crunch.

Your delicious homemade gulab jamuns are ready to be enjoyed!

    <h1>PASTA</h1>
   <h3> Ingredients:</h3>

8 oz (225g) spaghetti pasta
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 can (14 oz/400g) crushed tomatoes
1 teaspoon dried oregano
Salt and pepper to taste
Fresh basil leaves, torn
Grated Parmesan cheese (optional, for serving)
Instructions:

<h4>Cook the Spaghetti:</h4> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to package instructions until al dente (usually about 8-10 minutes). Drain the pasta, reserving about 1/2 cup of the pasta water.

<h4>Prepare the Sauce:</h4> While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant, being careful not to let it brown.

Add the crushed tomatoes and dried oregano to the skillet. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Allow the sauce to simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly.

<h4>Combine Pasta and Sauce:</h4> Add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet with the tomato sauce. Toss well to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce. If the sauce seems too thick, you can add some of the reserved pasta water to loosen it up.

<h4>Serve:</h4> Transfer the spaghetti with tomato sauce to serving plates. Top with torn fresh basil leaves and grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.

<h4>Enjoy:</h4> Serve hot and enjoy your delicious spaghetti with tomato sauce and basil!
